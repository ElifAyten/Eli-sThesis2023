# Realistic to Surrealistic Image Generation With Vision Language Models
In this project we try to generate surrealistic images from realistic images. 

## Structure

* `Yolo2.ipnyb`: 
Data labeling notebook using YOLO.

* `elifthesisAnalysis.ipnyb`:
The analysis of results notebook.

* `baseimages`:
The six base image that are chosen for the generation.

* `YOLO_labeled`:
The labeled images.

*`Thesis_2023_November+28,+2023_08.19.zip`:
These zip files include the results from the survey. In the survey, four of the participants did not finish until the end, so the results section of the paper excludes them.

The other folders have the 249 generated images.
